    "Q.1> What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "Ans> Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to run multiple threads \n",
    "     (i.e., independent sequences of instructions) concurrently within a single process. \n",
    "     This means that different parts of the program can execute concurrently, allowing for \n",
    "     better utilization of available resources and potentially improving program performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Multithreading is often used in Python programs to perform long-running or I/O-bound tasks \n",
    "     without blocking the main thread of the program, which is responsible for user interface \n",
    "     and other essential functionality. By using multiple threads, the program can continue to \n",
    "     respond to user input and perform other tasks while the long-running or I/O-bound tasks are \n",
    "     executing in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The \"threading\" module is used to handle threads in Python. It provides a simple way to \n",
    "     create and manage threads within a Python program. The \"threading\" module is part of the \n",
    "     Python standard library, so it is available for use in any Python program without requiring \n",
    "     any additional installation."

    "    \n",
    "      activeCount(): This function returns the number of thread objects that are active in the current Python interpreter. \n",

    "\n",
    "     Increased performance: Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, \n",
    "     which can result in significant performance improvements, especially on systems with multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Better resource utilization: By sharing resources such as memory and I/O devices among multiple threads, \n",
    "     multithreading can reduce resource wastage and improve overall system utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Responsiveness: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to perform tasks \n",
    "     in the background while still responding to user input and other events.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Simplified program structure: Multithreading can simplify the structure of a program by allowing it to \n",
    "     be decomposed into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Increased complexity: Multithreaded programs can be more complex to write and debug than single-threaded \n",
    "    programs, especially when dealing with shared resources such as memory and I/O devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Increased resource consumption: Multithreading can increase resource consumption due to the overhead of \n",
    "    creating and managing multiple threads, as well as the increased use of shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Synchronization issues: Multithreading can lead to synchronization issues when multiple threads access \n",
    "    the same shared resources concurrently. These issues can be difficult to debug and can result in \n",
    "    unpredictable program behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Increased likelihood of errors: Multithreaded programs are more prone to errors such as deadlocks, \n",
    "    race conditions, and priority inversions, which can be difficult to diagnose and fix."

    "Q.6> Explain deadlocks and race conditions\n",
    "Ans> Deadlocks: Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked and waiting for each other to \n",
    "     release a resource that they need to proceed. In other words, each thread is waiting for a resource \n",
    "     that is currently held by another thread, and no thread can proceed until the resource is released. \n",
    "     This results in a situation where none of the threads can make progress, and the program becomes \n",

    "    Race conditions: Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the timing and order \n",
    "    of thread execution. In other words, the behavior of the program is dependent on which thread executes \n",
